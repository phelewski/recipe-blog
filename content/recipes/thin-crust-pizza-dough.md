2. Dissolve the yeast in 45g of ice cold water and the salt in another 45g of ice cold water.
3. Add the yeast water and salt water to the flour-butter mixture in the food processor. Pulse for 20-30 seconds until the dough is evenly hydrated. Be careful not to over mix.

6. Perform a preshape by folding in the sides and rounding off the dough into a ball. Cover the dough balls and let them rest for 20 minutes to relax the gluten.
7. Press the dough ball flat with a pizza pan or large pot then roll out each dough ball into a 12” (30cm) round
8. Use a pizza docking tool or a fork to pierce the dough to prevent large bubbles from forming during baking. Going up and down 8 times, rotating the pizza 90° and doing it again.
9. Spray 2 pieces of parchment paper with olive oil pan spray and a generous amount of fine grind cornmeal and place rolled out pizza doughs on top.
10. Place both doughs stacked on a sheet tray and refrigerate, uncovered, for 4-24 hours to cold ferment and develop a skin for a crispier crust. Preferably 24 hours.
11. Bake on convection @550°f directly on pizza steel
