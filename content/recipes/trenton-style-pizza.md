## Instructions

### Dough Prep

1. Combine all ingredients to bowl of a stand mixer with dough hook attachment
2. Mix on low speed for 1-2 minutes, until dough forms into a mass.
3. Increase speed to medium-high and mix for 4 more minutes
4. When the dough becomes smooth and doesn't tear when you tug it, it's done
5. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions (250g each) and shape into a taut ball
6. Place each dough ball into a well oiled bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 1-2 days
7. Remove the dough balls 3 hours before you want to eat the pizza and let them come up to room temp

### Sauce

1. Remove 3 whole tomatoes from the can and roughly chop them
2. Add tomato paste, oregano, basil, chili flakes, salt, and sugar to the 28oz can of tomatoes and puree with immersion blender until smooth
3. Heat large saute pan over medium-high heat and add olive oil
4. Add in garlic, stir and saute for about 30 seconds
5. Add in chopped tomatoes and stir for another minute until reduced slightly
6. Add the rest of the tomato puree to the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook for 15 minutes or until the sauce has reduced by half

### Pizza

1. Preheat oven to 550°f convection with pizza steel for 1 hour
2. Flour the work surface and one of the doughs
3. Roll out dough into 10" round shape before finishing with hand stretching to 12" in total size
4. Dust pizza peel with semolina flour and load dough onto peel
5. Spread about 2 cups of the chilled mozzarella cheese to the dough, followed by a generous pinch of grated parmesan
6. Add several large spoonfuls of sauce to the pizza on top and spread only slightly, leaving plenty of unsauced surface area
7. Load the pizza onto the pizza steel and cook for 6 minutes, until the bottom is crisped up and the top is well browned
8. Place on a wire rack to cool slightly before slicing and serving
