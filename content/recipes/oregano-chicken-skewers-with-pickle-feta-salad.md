- 9 Tbsp olive oil, plus more

- ⅔ cup sliced pickled pepperoncini
- ⅔ cup walnuts or pecans

Dairy

- 3 ounces feta cheese

Meat

- 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 1½ lbs)

## Instructions

### Marinate the chicken

1. Slice the chicken thighs into roughly 1 inch wide strips length wise (will ribbon onto skewers)
2. In a bowl, combine and whisk together ¼ cup red wine vinegar, ¼ cup olive oil, 6 grated garlic cloves, oregano, 2½ tsp salt, and 1 tsp pepper
3. Add the chicken strips to the marinade mixture and toss thoroughly
4. Let marinate for at least 1 hour, overnight is ok too

### Make the Salad

1. Cut the cucumbers on the bias with a roll cut
2. Slice the the pickles into about somewhat thin slices, but not too thin
3. Thinly slice the scallions
4. Chop the pepperoncinis and fresh dill
5. Microplane the remaining garlic clove
6. Combine all of the ingredients into a large salad bowl
7. Add 3 Tbsp each of red wine vinegar and olive oil to the mixture
8. Add salt and pepper to taste
9. Mix everything together very well
10. Right before serving, crumble in the feta and toasted walnuts

### Grill the Chicken

1. Get the grill going on fairly high direct heat, about 500°f
   > Ensure the grates are clean and slightly oiled
2. Skewer the marinated chicken onto metal skewers or soaked wooden skewers, 2 slices per skewer (makes roughly 6 skewers)
3. Add the chicken skewers to the grill and let cook on one side for 3-4 minutes
4. Flip/rotate the skewers once the side is nicely seared and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes per side
5. Continue rotating as needed until the chicken is fully cooked
6. Remove from the grill and rest on a plate for about 5 minutes
   > Now would be a good time to add the cheese and walnuts to the salad

## Notes/Tips

This can be made on the grill or on the stove in a cast iron pan
