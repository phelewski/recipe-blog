## Timing

- **Prep Time:** 10 minutes
- **Cook Time:** 16 hours
- **Total Time:** 20 hours
- **Servings:** 16

## Ingredients

- Bone in pork butt (approximately 10lbs)
- Yellow mustard or olive oil (for binder)
- Seasoning of choice
  - 2 parts salt, 2 parts pepper, 1 part garlic or pre-made mix
- 1/3 cup Apple cider vinegar
- 1/3 cup Apple juice
- 1/3 cup BBQ sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the pellet grill to 200°f and add some pecan smoking chunks to the smoke box
2. Open the pork butt and remove it from the package. Pat it dry and use your hands to feel for any bone shards or loose bits. Remove them.
3. Score the fat cap in a cross hatch pattern
4. Lightly coat the meat with the binder of your choosing
5. Coat the meat with the seasoning, making sure to get all sides covered
6. Let meat sweat with seasoning in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, longer is ok
7. Place meat on top rack away from the heat source, fat cap up
8. Smoke meat untouched for about 12 hours
9. Add more smoking chunks to the smoke box as needed (every 40ish minutes) for the first 3-4 hours
10. Check the temperature of the meat, if it's around 165°f (the stall), remove the meat from the grill and place in a deep disposable aluminum foil pan
11. Add about a cups worth of the apple cider vinegar, apple juice, and bbq sauce to the foil pan and mix
12. Cover the foil pan with the meat and liquids with aluminum foil, creasing it tight
13. Place back on the top rack of the grill and adjust the grill temperature to 250°f
14. Add a thermometer probe to the meat and start checking for doneness (tenderness) when the internal temperature reaches 190°f
    1. The meat should be very tender, feel like poking a probe through room temperature butter, no resistance. This may not occur until 205°f
15. Remove the covered foil pan and place in an empty cooler with a couple of towels for heat protection
16. Let rest in the cooler for at least 2 hours
17. Pull/shred the meat, serve, and enjoy
